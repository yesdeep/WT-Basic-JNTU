e C programming language is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard. The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs have been written in C. The C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons.  Easy to learn  Structured language  It produces efficient programs.  It can handle low-level activities.  It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms. Facts about C
 C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.  C is a successor of B language, which was introduced around 1970.  The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute. (ANSI).  The UNIX OS was totally written in C by 1973. CHAPTER 1

Before you start doing programming using C programming language, you need the following two softwares available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler. Text EditorText Editor This will be used to type your program. Examples of few editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi. Name and version of text editor can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as Linux or UNIX. The files you create with your editor are called source files and contain program source code. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension “.c”. Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it. The C CompilerThe C Compiler The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", to turn into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per instructions given. This C programming language compiler will be used to compile your source code into final executable program. I assume you have basic knowledge about a programming language compiler. Most frequently used and free available compiler is GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have respective Operating Systems. Following section guides you on how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. I'm mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages. CHAPTER 2

Installation on Installation on UNIXUNIX/Linux/Linux If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line: $ gcc -v If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message something as follows: Using built-in specs. Target: i386-redhat-linux Configured with: ../configure --prefix=/usr ....... Thread model: posix gcc version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-46) If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available athttp://gcc.gnu.org/install/ This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on Cent OS flavor of Linux system. Installation on Mac OSInstallation on Mac OS If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++. Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/. Installation on WindowsInstallation on Windows To install GCC at Windows you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage, www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe. While installing MinWG, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more. Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names. When the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in upcoming chapters. C HeC Hello World Examplello World Example A C program basically consists of the following parts:  Preprocessor Commands  Functions  Variables  Statements & Expressions  Comments Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World": #include <stdio.h> int main() { /* my first program in C */ printf("Hello, World! \n"); return 0; } Let us look various parts of the above program: CHAPTER 3

1. The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation. 2. The next line int main() is the main function where program execution begins. 3. The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program. 4. The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen. 5. The next line return 0; terminates main()function and returns the value 0. Compile & ExecuteCompile & Execute C ProgramC Program Let’s look at how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps: 1. Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code. 2. Save the file as hello.c 3. Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you saved the file. 4. Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code. 5. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file. 6. Now, type a.out to execute your program. 7. You will be able to see "Hello World" printed on the screen $ gcc hello.c $ ./a.out Hello, World! Make sure that gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing source file hello.c.

C Basic Syntax
C Basic Syntax This chapter will This chapter will give detailgive detailss about all the basic syntax about C programming language about all the basic syntax about C programming language including toincluding tokens, keywords, identifierskens, keywords, identifiers,, etcetc.. You have seen a basic structure of C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language. Tokens in CTokens in C A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens: printf("Hello, World! \n"); The individual tokens are: printf ( "Hello, World! \n" ) ; Semicolons ;Semicolons ; In C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity. For example, following are two different statements: printf("Hello, World! \n"); return 0; CHAPTER 4

CommentsComments Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminates with the characters */ as shown below: /* my first program in C */ You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals. IdentifiersIdentifiers A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore _ followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9). C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers: mohd zara abc move_name a_123 myname50 _temp j a23b9 retVal KeywordsKeywords The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constant or variable or any other identifier names. auto else Long switch break enum register typedef case extern return union char float short unsigned const for signed void continue goto sizeof volatile default if static while do int struct _packed double

Whitespace in CWhitespace in C A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it. Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement: int age; There must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement: fruit = apples + oranges; // get the total fruit No whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish for readability purpose.

C Data Types
C Data Types In the C programming language, data types refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted. The types in C can be classified as follows: S.N. Types and Description 1 Basic Types: They are arithmetic types and consists of the two types: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types. 2 Enumerated types: They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only be assigned certain discrete integer values throughout the program. 3 The type void: The type specifier void indicates that no value is available. 4 Derived types: They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types. The array types and structure types are referred to collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see basic types in the following section, whereas, other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters. Integer TypesInteger Types Following table gives you details about standard integer types with its storage sizes and value ranges: Type Storage size Value range Char 1 byte -128 to 127 or 0 to 255 unsigned char 1 byte 0 to 255 CHAPTER 5

signed char 1 byte -128 to 127 Int 2 or 4 bytes -32,768 to 32,767 or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 unsigned int 2 or 4 bytes 0 to 65,535 or 0 to 4,294,967,295 Short 2 bytes -32,768 to 32,767 unsigned short 2 bytes 0 to 65,535 Long 4 bytes -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 unsigned long 4 bytes 0 to 4,294,967,295 To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Following is an example to get the size of int type on any machine: #include <stdio.h> #include <limits.h> int main() { printf("Storage size for int : %d \n", sizeof(int)); return 0; } When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux: Storage size for int : 4 FloatingFloating--Point TypesPoint Types Following table gives you details about standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision: Type Storage size Value range Precision float 4 byte 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38 6 decimal places double 8 byte 2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308 15 decimal places long double 10 byte 3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+4932 19 decimal places The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. Following example will print storage space taken by a float type and its range values: #include <stdio.h> #include <float.h> int main()

{ printf("Storage size for float : %d \n", sizeof(float)); printf("Minimum float positive value: %E\n", FLT_MIN ); printf("Maximum float positive value: %E\n", FLT_MAX ); printf("Precision value: %d\n", FLT_DIG ); return 0; } When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux: Storage size for float : 4 Minimum float positive value: 1.175494E-38 Maximum float positive value: 3.402823E+38 Precision value: 6 The void TypeThe void Type The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations: S.N. Types and Description 1 Function returns as void There are various functions in C which do not return value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status); 2 Function arguments as void There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept as a void. For example, int rand(void); 3 Pointers to void A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type. The void type may not be understood to you at this point, so let us proceed and we will cover these concepts in the upcoming
